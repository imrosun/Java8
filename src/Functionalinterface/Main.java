/* In Java 8, a new notion called functional interfaces was introduced.
A Functional Interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method.
To designate an interface as a Functional Interface,
we don’t need to use the @FunctionalInterface annotation.
The @FunctionalInterface annotation prevents abstract methods from being accidentally
added to functional interfaces. It’s similar to a @Override annotation,
and it’s recommended that you use it. java.lang. Runnable is a fantastic example of
a functional interface since it has one abstract method, run ().
One of the most appealing features of the functional interface is
creating objects using lambda expressions. We can create an interface using an anonymous class
